# Design decisions

One file per decision, numbered, append-only. This is the record of **why** the system is the way it is; the code and Figma show **what** it is.

- **Never rewrite** an accepted decision. To change it, add a new one and mark the old `superseded by NNNN`.
- **Rule** is the line that gets applied to new components and pages. Write it as an instruction.
- No token values in a decision: name the tokens, the values live in `tokens.json`.
- Open questions and parked gaps are not decisions: they live in [`../open.md`](../open.md) until they are decided.

## Template

```md
# NNNN — Title

`YYYY-MM-DD` · accepted | superseded by NNNN · Figma: <node or —>

**Context.** What forced the choice (one or two sentences).
**Decision.** What was chosen.
**Rule.** The instruction to apply from now on.
**Where.** Files / components that implement it.
```
